# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a program within our computers that tracks changes in code. It stands for Global Information Tracker. It is different from Github in the sense that Github is a server that information is sent to. Github is used to help developers work on individual branches of a main project, without interfering with eachother.

Researched answer: Git, (Global Information Tracker) is a tool in order to manage different versions of open source code. This was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Github is used to transfer and upload files in a Git repository. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: To return a Boolean value: less than, greater than, strict equality, loose equality, and and, the bang operator are utilized. There may be a few that I am missing. These operator need to return a true or false statement in the terminal.  

Researched answer: less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, strict equality, loose equality, and, or, not, logical and, logical or, and logical not.    

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: The index is the location of strings and arrays. For example, the 2nd index of "cat" would be the letter "t". The value is what's declared using a variable. 

Researched answer: The index represents the elements of an array. The value is the content of an element.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: The biggest difference between arrays and strings is that arrays can contain multiple elements, and strings, only one. Arrays are coded in javascript using the square brackets. Strings are recognized with either single or double quotation marks.
Arrays and strings are similar in that, within the code block, the terminal
cannot read what is written. The data within either a string or array can be well written English, or mashing the computer keys. What's contained in the array or string is for humans, nothing the terminal processes.

Researched answer: An array is a collection of elements with the same data types, a string is a series of characters. Both arrays and strings store information, and indexed, so the data can be accessed by its location. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: In pair programming, it's best to have a driver and a navigator. The driver is the developer who is physically writing and running the code. The navigators role is to steer the driver in the right direction, providing the step by step process of code syntax, while referencing the strategies to solve their problem. Switching between these roles is a very good tool in order to give one another a break, and to put fresh eyes on the task at hand. 

Researched answer: Driver/Navigator : Driver in charge of the keyboard, writes and tests code
                                      Navigator guides the driver
                                      

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: built in methods within JavaScript that uses a function as an argument.
These functions are specific to arrays, and argues every item within the array.

2. Jest: Created by Meta, Jest is a testing framework that creates quality assurance for code. This is made of a collection of files called: dependencies that contain snippets of code used to run a test.

3. Objects: This is a data type in JavaScript that has collections of key:value pairs. They are stored in curly braces and contain information, actions, and functions.  

4. Method:This references the object in JavaScript, when a function belongs to an object.  

5. Classes: Very similar to functions in that Classes have their own scope, contain data, and behavior. They can store any kind of data, as well as be reused like functions.
